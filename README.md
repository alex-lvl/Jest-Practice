## Jest Practice

### Overview
This repository is meant to store and show my attempts of testing code using Jest.

### Features
To begin practicing, functions were created to be able to begin testing. 

- A capitalize function was created to take a string and returns the first character capitalized.
- A reverseString function was built to take a string and reverse it.
- A calculator object was built to contain basic operations such as add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
- A caesarCipher and decipher function were built to cipher and decipher text.
- An arrayAnalysis function was built to take an array of numbers and returns an object with average, min, max, and length values.

### Testing Objectives
Each function mentioned above was built to be tested in certain ways. For example:

- The capitalize function was tested to return the first character capitalized.
- Testing was done on the reverseString function to ensure the string passed through was reversed.
- The calculator object was tested to ensure the basic operations were functional and returned the correct values.
- The Caesar Cipher function was tested for wrapping a-z, keeping the same case, and punctuation.
- The array analysis function was tested for validity and correct analysis.
